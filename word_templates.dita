    <body>
        <p>I have two Microsoft Word templates available for sharing as PDFs. Why PDF, you say?
            Well, these are my works and if you like what you see then you can ask me about them. </p>
        <p>
            <note>These were former work products but they are posted in a generic format. See the
                link below for example how-to use this template procedures.</note>
        </p>
